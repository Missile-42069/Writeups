The Planet's Prestige Write-up
By: Missile_42069

CoCanDa, a planet known as 'The Heaven of the Universe' has been having a bad year. A series of riots have taken place across the planet due 
to the frequent abduction of citizens, known as CoCanDians, by a mysterious force. CoCanDa’s Planetary President arranged a war-room with the 
best brains and military leaders to work on a solution. After the meeting concluded the President was informed his daughter had disappeared. CoCanDa
agents spread across multiple planets were working day and night to locate her. Two days later and there’s no update on the situation, no demand for 
ransom, not even a single clue regarding the whereabouts of the missing people. On the third day a CoCanDa representative, an Army Major on Earth, 
received an email.

3. What is the filetype of the recieved attachment which helped to continue the investigation?

after unzipping the seemingly .pdf file (which is weird tbh)

Scanning the file Money.xlsx using binwalk, we can see the list of the zip archive as listed below

upon extracting the files, we can see that they are bunch of xml file, but upon opening the sharedStrings.xml, 
there is a string encrypted in base64 "VGhlIE1hcnRpYW4gQ29sb255LCBCZXNpZGUgSW50ZXJwbGFuZXRhcnkgU3BhY2Vwb3J0Lg==" upon 
decoding the text using Cyberchef in base64 we can see the location The Martian Colony, Beside Interplanetary Spaceport.
